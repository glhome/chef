The contents of this directory will be linked into your home directory,
allowing you to modify shell and application dotfiles to suit your needs.

Take care that if you provide a custom .bashrc, that you set up your PATH as:

export PATH=/opt/opscode/embedded/bin:$PATH

You can also choose to specify a custom dotfiles location, so that it's not tied to this repository
(allowing you to safely nuke the repo and not lose your dotfiles)

To do this, edit or create config.yml and add the following:

    vm:
      dotfile_host_path=/path/to/your/dotfiles
