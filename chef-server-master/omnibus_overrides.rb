# Note 2018/02/01 (sr): This is related to issue #1417:
# This is the last version that supports --with-lua51=PATH, which allows us to
# build it with lua on ppc64[le] and s390x. Those platforms are not supported
# in mainline luajit. There's forks for ppc64, and s390x, but going forward with
# those was so far blocked by ppc64 not being supported even with the PPC64
# fork.
