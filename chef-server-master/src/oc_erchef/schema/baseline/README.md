Baseline Chef Server PostgreSQL Schema
======================================

This directory contains the original chef-server-schema that the
current schema builds on top of.  In most cases, no new changes should
happen here.

If you need to make a schema change for an update to Open Source Chef
Server 11, you will likely need to make your change in the following
repository:
