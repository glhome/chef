  Universe API

  The universe is the known collection of cookbooks that have been uploaded
  to the organization.
  The universe is JSON data organized by cookbook, then by cookbook version,
  and then by a dependency graph that lists each dependency a cookbook version
  may have on other cookbooks or cookbook versions.

  Use the /universe endpoint to retrieve the known collection of cookbooks,
  and then use it with Berkshelf.
