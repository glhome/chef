# Maintainers

This file lists how the Chef Identity project is maintained. When making changes
to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a
simple majority of maintainers for the relevant subsystems to provide a :+1: on
your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a
Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out
[How Chef is Maintained](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc030-maintenance-policy.md#how-the-project-is-maintained)

project lead.
